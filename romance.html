			<div class="desc"><h3>Sayaka Murata's <div class="title">Convenience Store Woman</div></h3>
			<p>Sayaka Murata's first novel translated into English is a quirky treat. 36-year-old Keiko is unmarried, childless and has been working part-time at the same convenience store in Japan for the last 18 years. And she brings insurmountable shame to her family and friends because of it. Keiko is a puzzling character. Mostly because Murata formulates her protagonist and narrative with opaque neutrality; we’re never sure if she condones, respects, admires or admonishes Keiko’s quirks. Coupled with the easy-breezy, almost luminescent writing style, it’s difficult to unravel Murata’s intentions with this book. Keiko believes that she exists to serve the convenience store. It governs her actions and the way she lives her life. She eats to be energised to serve the store, she sleeps to ensure she will be in peak physical form to serve the store, the store occupies her dreams and waking moments when she’s not there. She can anticipate the store’s needs. Where she seems to lack empathy on a human level, she oozes it for the store, as if it is a living organism in its own right. It is the love story between a woman and her convenience store.

			<p>Bringing the fake romance trope to grown-ups, If I Never Met You plays with the love motif made famous by Lara Jean and her love letters. Following amibitous and recently single Laurie, and the handsome embodiment of the work-hard-play-harder dictum that is Jamie, two lawyers enter into a fake relationship of convenience intended to help them both. But, as they always do, things get complicated…</p> </div>

			<div class="desc"><h3>Sally Rooney's <div class="title">Normal People</div></h3>
			<p>Sally Rooney is a remarkable writer, not for her creative interpretation of grammar and portraying connection through an incongruous absence of speech marks—but for her sheer understanding of youth. She writes youthful anxiety in an otherwise unparalleled way. Her narrative is deeply emotive, her sex scenes are remarkably tender, she's not afraid to write awkwardness and ugliness. She wraps the ugliness of humanity in this beautiful relationship between two people who will always return to each other. Her evocation of sense of place is masterful; her descriptions vivid yet understated. I'm always curious why people think this novel is pretentious: if they can just see past the eccentricities in style, it's a book enshrined in humility, humanity and love. </div>

			<p>24-year-old Yola and her middle-class Venezuelan family's life in Trinidad changes forever following the death of her Aunt Celia and the revelation of her debt to an underworld immigration gang. To pay off her debt the family are forced to work for crime lord Ugly, hosting immigrant families he smuggles into Trinidad illegally. Not ideal. But even worse, Yola develops some very lustful feelings for Ugly's right-hand man, Román… 
			Mackenzie's mastery is enmeshing the themes of violence, immigration, societal ills within a veil of humour, keeping it relatable. Her nugget of genius is the moral dilemma at the crux of the novel: are all illegal immigrants criminals? And yet, despite this recurrence to a very heavy them, the novel is light, romantic and comic. I really appreciate this painting of Trinidad: it's an island full of different races and ethnicities, but it's seldom explored in pop culture. In my experience, predominantly the Afro-Caribbean or Indo-Caribbean experience is presented, and I love the exploration of another racial composition of the islands.</p>

			<p>This glorious pick-me-up is just the tonic for a day when you're feeling blue, and even makes the prospect of public transport seem appealing. Nadia and Daniel both get the 7:30am tube train every morning, who become quasi-romantic pen pals via posts in the love letters section of the newspaper. Despite their lives intersecting in so many (unexpected) ways, their relationship is categorised by comical near-misses. It's a very cutesy story, but also a story of millennial romance with lots of millennial motifs, booming sexual politics and a really cool, well-rounded set of characters. It's a predictable story, but in the most satisfying way possible. Overall, there's not much not to like.

			<p> beautiful story centred around a forbidden love story. The summer after Nadia's mother's death and before she leaves her small hometown for college, she enters into a whirlwind, secret romance with pastor's son Luke. When she aborts an unwanted pregancy their relationship ends in a physical sense, but even years later it ceases to end on an emotional and spiritual level despite them both entering into serious long-term relationships with other people. Their symbiotic pull towards each other due to the baby is explored throughout the book along with other iterations of mothering and motherhood. It's a beautiful, lyrical novel and tremendous for a debut.</p>

			<p>I had a tough time with Baby. It's an infuriating, ugly story centring around a very infuriating protagonist, Cynthia. She's 21, listless, lazy and just waiting for her life to start. Her only productive activity is attending fitness instructor Anahera's aerobics classes and lusting after her. One day, Anahera appears at her door, proclaiming a broken marriage and a need to get away. So, they take all of Cynthia's father's money, drive off and purchase 'Baby' the boat, where very unsettling events unfold. Anahera is a guarded and evasive character; she openly states that she wholeheartedly believes she belongs to no one. I've read this book and reflected on it a lot, and still struggle to determine the nature of their relationship; there's certainly some connection there, but I'm not sure if it's a reflection of Cynthia yearning for female, maternal connection, an object for her fascination, or a manifestation of romantic, deep love. Jochems has said she felt very unimpressed by her generation and wrote this book as a response; it's an interesting read either way
